The function fills a gap in the presently available subset selection software, which typically searches over a range of subset sizes, restricts the types of objective functions considered, or does not include freely available code. The new function is demonstrated on two types of problem where a fixed-size subset search is desirable: design of environmental monitoring networks, and D-optimal design of experiments. Additionally, the performance is evaluated on a class of constructed test problems with a novel design that is interesting in its own right.},

A predictive model for the BGA is presented that is derived from quantitative genetics. The model is used to predict the behavior of the BGA for simple test functions. Different mutation schemes are compared by computing the expected progress to the solution. The numerical performance of the BGA is demonstrated on a test suite of multimodal functions. The number of function evaluations needed to locate the optimum scales only as n ln(n) where n is the number of parameters. Results up to n = 1000 are reported.},

  abstract  = {After adequately demonstrating the ability to solve different two-objective optimization
problems, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) must now show their efficacy in
handling problems having more than two objectives. In this paper, we have suggested three
different approaches for systematically designing test problems for this purpose. The simplicity
of construction, scalability to any number of decision variables and objectives, knowledge of
exact shape and location of the resulting Pareto-optimal front, and introduction of controlled
difficulties in both converging to the true Pareto-optimal front and maintaining a widely
distributed set of solutions are the main features of the suggested test problems. Because
of the above features, they should be found useful in various research activities on MOEAs,
such as testing the performance of a new MOEA, comparing different MOEAs, and better
understanding of the working principles of MOEAs.},
